# Calculator written in JavaScript
Hello to anyone who is looking!
My name is Dom and this has been my first take at a proper usage of JavaScript. I tried to incorporate it into a calculator, so I can train my ability to write
HTML and CSS code as well. I also tried to train my ability to use SCSS compiler to the best of my abilities.

This project is just a simple calculator. There is nothing else to it, feel free to look!
